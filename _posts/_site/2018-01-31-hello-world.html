<p>Here’s to starting this blog with the archetypal introductory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program">greeting</a> in computer programming.</p>

<p>My goals for starting this blog are twofold. Firstly, I want to understand bits of computer science and math better by writing short posts explaining what I learnt. After all, teaching
is the <a href="https://lifehacker.com/the-feynman-technique-helps-you-study-faster-and-retain-1790501936">best</a> way to learn.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to improve my writing skills by practicing regularly, and I’m hoping that
having a blog would provide extra motivation to write.</p>

<p>Here is my previous <a href="http://theprocrastinator.wordpress.com">attempt</a> at blogging, from many years ago.</p>

<p>I hope to have a long-running blog, full of interesting posts!</p>
