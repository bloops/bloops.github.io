Here's to starting this blog with the archetypal introductory [greeting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program) in computer programming.

My goals for starting this blog are twofold. Firstly, I want to understand bits of computer science and math better by writing short posts explaining what I learnt. After all, teaching
is the [best](https://lifehacker.com/the-feynman-technique-helps-you-study-faster-and-retain-1790501936) way to learn.

Secondly, I want to improve my writing skills by practicing regularly, and I'm hoping that
having a blog would provide extra motivation to write.

Here is my previous [attempt](http://theprocrastinator.wordpress.com) at blogging, from many years ago.

I hope to have a long-running blog, full of interesting posts!
